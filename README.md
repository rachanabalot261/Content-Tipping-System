# Content Tipping System

## Project Description
The Content Tipping System is a decentralized application that enables users to directly support and reward content creators with cryptocurrency tips. Each tip is recorded on-chain for full transparency, showing who tipped whom, for what content, and how much.

## Project Vision
To empower creators and artists by offering a decentralized, transparent, and censorship-resistant way for fans to show appreciation â€” bypassing middlemen and high platform fees.

## Key Features
- Users can send Ether tips directly to content creators.
- Each tip is stored immutably with details: sender, receiver, amount, message, and content reference.
- Instant payments directly to creators' wallets.
- Transparent record of all tipping activities.

## Future Scope
- Add ERC20 token-based tipping (custom tokens or stablecoins).
- Creator profiles and statistics dashboards.
- Optional off-chain metadata (e.g., IPFS integration for content).
- Role-based access or content verification system.
- Frontend dApp integration for one-click tipping.
